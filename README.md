This project uses data from MLB Gameday using the Baseball on a Stick program. So, you can use that program to create a SQL database of Gameday statistics. The full project report is published on FanGraphs and I will add more code to the repository as I expand and develop the project. Please let me know if you have any feedback/comments.
Additionally, the code is saved as an R Markdown file.
